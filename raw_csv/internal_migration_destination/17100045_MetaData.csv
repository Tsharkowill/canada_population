1,"Estimates for the quarter: Q1 = January to March; Q2 = April to June; Q3 = July to September; Q4 = October to December."
2,"Interprovincial migration represents movements from one province or territory to another, involving a change in usual place of residence. A person who takes up residence in another province or territory is an out-migrant with reference to the province or territory of origin, and an in-migrant with reference to the province or territory of destination."
3,"From July 1971 to June 1976, estimates are based on Family Allowance data. From July 1976 to June 2022, estimates are based on Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) tax data. From July 2022, estimates are based on Canada child benefit data."
4,"From July 1971 to June 1976, estimates were based on Family Allowance data. From July 1976 to June 1991, estimates were based on Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) tax data. Data for Northwest Territories and Nunavut are presented separately from July 1991."
5,"From July 1976 to June 1991, total in-migrants, total out-migrants and net migration do not include migration between Nunavut and Northwest Territories."
6,"Prior to July 1991, only data for Northwest Territories and Nunavut combined are available. From July 1991 to June 2022, estimates are based on Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) tax data. From July 2022, estimates are based on Canada child benefit data from CRA."
7,"The number of interprovincial migrants is final up to June 2022, updated from July 2022 to March 2023 and preliminary from April 2023."
8,"The population growth, which is used to calculate population estimates, is comprised of the natural growth (Table 17100059), international migration (Table 17100040) and interprovincial migration (Tables 17100020 and 17100045)."
9,"As Canada child benefit (CCB) microdata are used from July 2011 onwards, quarterly interprovincial in- and out-migrants estimates for years before 2011 are not entirely comparable to subsequent estimates. It is also normal for the sum of quarterly in- and out- interprovincial migrants not to be equal to the number of yearly interprovincial in- and out- migrants from 2011 onwards. It is however possible to add the quarterly net interprovincial migration estimates to get the annual estimates. For more detail regarding the methodology used to estimate interprovincial migration, please refer to chapter 7 of the publication catalogue no. 91-528-X."
