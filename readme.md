# Canadian Population Analysis Project 🇨🇦📊

Welcome to my repository for the **Canadian Population Analysis Project**. This project explores Canada's dynamic demographic landscape, driven by a combination of rapid immigration and global trends such as declining birth rates in the West.

## 📖 Project Overview

In recent years, Canada’s population growth has garnered significant media attention, particularly due to its rapid increase driven by progressive immigration policies. At the same time, global concerns about declining birth rates in developed countries—especially in the West—have sparked further interest in demographic trends. This inspired me to delve into Canada's population statistics, explore current trends, and uncover unique aspects of the country's demographic landscape.
